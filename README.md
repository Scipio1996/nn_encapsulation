## Capsule Project

Note: this is an **on-going** branch (called `dev`) for the capsule project - meaning incomplete documents.

It supports pytorch ``0.4.x`` only. 
We suggest you look at the ``master``  branch first if you are new to our work.


I would most likely not respond to the pull request on this branch. 

- Most of `utils` functions is directly from those in the
[object detection repo](https://github.com/hli2020/object_detection/tree/master/utils).


- Update torchvision: `conda install torchvision -c pytorch`
