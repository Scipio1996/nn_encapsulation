## Capsule Project (`dev` branch)

Note: this is an on-going branch for the capsule project. It supports pytorch ``0.4.x`` only. 
We suggest you look at the ``master``     branch first if you are new to our work.

- Most of `utils` functions is directly from those in the
[object detection repo](https://github.com/hli2020/object_detection/tree/master/utils).


- Update torchvision: `conda install torchvision -c pytorch`
