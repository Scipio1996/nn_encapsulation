# Capsule project

### Explain the mechanism

### Multiple capsule layers

### Some theory here

### File structure

- Most of `utils` functions is directly from those in the
[object detection repo](https://github.com/hli2020/object_detection/tree/master/utils).

- For now the capsule theory is mainly verified on small datasets.

- Update torchvision: `conda install torchvision -c pytorch`
